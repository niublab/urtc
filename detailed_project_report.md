# Project Summary Report

## Project Overview

The project aims to enhance the existing `pymath` library by adding new mathematical functionalities and improving its robustness. This includes implementing a prime number checking function, adding comprehensive unit tests, and ensuring the library is well-documented and user-friendly.

## Key Achievements

1.  **Implemented `is_prime` function:** A new function `is_prime(n)` was added to `pymath/lib/math.py` to determine if a given integer `n` is a prime number. The implementation handles edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and one.
2.  **Added Unit Tests for `is_prime`:** Comprehensive unit tests were created in `pymath/tests/test_math.py` to verify the correctness of the `is_prime` function. These tests cover various scenarios, including prime numbers, non-prime numbers, edge cases, and invalid inputs.
3.  **Updated README:** The `pymath/README.md` file was updated to include documentation for the new `is_prime` function, providing users with information on its usage and behavior.
4.  **Generated Detailed Project Report:** This report (`detailed_project_report.md`) was created to summarize the project's objectives, achievements, and outcomes.

## Code Changes

### `pymath/lib/math.py`

*   Added the `is_prime(n)` function:
    ```python
    def is_prime(n):
      """Checks if a number is a prime number."""
      if n <= 1:
        return False
      for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
          return False
      return True
    ```

### `pymath/tests/test_math.py`

*   Added a new test class `TestIsPrime` with the following test methods:
    *   `test_prime_numbers`: Tested known prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).
    *   `test_non_prime_numbers`: Tested known non-prime numbers (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20).
    *   `test_edge_cases`: Tested edge cases (0, 1, -2, -10).
    *   `test_large_prime`: Tested a larger prime number (e.g., 97).
    *   `test_large_non_prime`: Tested a larger non-prime number (e.g., 100).

### `pymath/README.md`

*   Added `is_prime(n)` to the list of functions.
*   Included `is_prime` in the usage example.

## Testing and Validation

All unit tests, including those for the new `is_prime` function, pass successfully. This indicates that the new functionality is implemented correctly and integrates well with the existing codebase.

## Future Work

*   Consider adding more advanced mathematical functions to the library.
*   Explore performance optimizations for existing functions, especially for large inputs.
*   Enhance the documentation with more detailed examples and explanations.

## Conclusion

The project successfully extended the `pymath` library with a new prime number checking function and corresponding unit tests. The documentation was updated to reflect these changes, ensuring the library remains user-friendly and maintainable. The project met its objectives and delivered a more comprehensive and robust mathematical library.
